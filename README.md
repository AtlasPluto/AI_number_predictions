A school project made from an uncomplete "skeleton" code from our teacher, i made the cnn structure and configured the functions for them to work. It is  a cnn that you train on a dataset and it will recognize numbers from 0 to 15. Avarage accuracy with the current settings is 93%.


I didnt upload the database itself just the csv for it as the database is 3800 imgs and that would take to much time.
